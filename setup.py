    This module sets up the Greynir package. It uses the cffi_modules
    parameter, available in recent versions of setuptools, to
    automatically compile the eparser.cpp module to eparser.*.so/.pyd
    and build the required CFFI Python wrapper via eparser_build.py.
    The same applies to bin.cpp -> bin.*.so and bin_build.py.

    Note that installing under PyPy >= 3.9 is supported (and recommended
    for best performance).
